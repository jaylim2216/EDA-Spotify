### Exploratory Data Analysis of Spotify Audio Features: Unveiling the Rhythm of My Music
#### Introduction:
In this Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project, I delved into the world of my personal Spotify music library. By leveraging the Spotify API, I extracted audio features data for my most listened songs in 2022, and utilized the powerful pandas and seaborn libraries to gain insights and explore patterns within the data. This project allowed me to better understand the musical characteristics of my favorite songs in 2022, providing me with valuable knowledge and potentially uncovering intriguing correlations.

#### Benefits:
1. Understanding Musical Preferences: By analyzing the audio features of my Spotify songs, such as danceability, loudness, and acousticness, I gained a deeper understanding of my musical preferences. This exploration helps in identifying patterns and uncovering the types of songs that resonate with me the most. From this project, it seems that I prefer songs with lower energy and a slower tempo!

2. Personalized Recommendations: Analyzing audio features can provide valuable insights into the characteristics of songs that appeal to me. This knowledge can be leveraged to create personalized recommendations, both for discovering new songs and curating playlists that align with my preferences.

3. Data-Driven Decision Making: By analyzing the audio features, I can make more informed decisions when selecting songs for specific moods or activities. For example, understanding the tempo or valence of a song can guide choices for workout sessions, relaxation, or focus-intensive tasks.

#### Limitations: 
1. Limited Dataset Size: The analysis is constrained by the size of my playlist. Although it provides insights into my music preferences, the findings may not be generalisable to my music taste as a whole since I only analysed songs that I listened to in 2022. 
     
2. Data Quality and Reliability: The accuracy and consistency of audio features provided by the Spotify API could impact the results. It is essential to be aware of potential limitations or inconsistencies in the data that may affect the analysis outcomes.
     
3. Lack of Contextual Information: Audio features alone do not encompass the entirety of a song's appeal. Contextual information, such as lyrics, artist background, or cultural significance, is not considered in this analysis, limiting a comprehensive understanding of the music.
     
    
#### Conclusion
This EDA project utilising the Spotify API, pandas, and seaborn libraries enabled me to explore the audio features of my Spotify songs, unraveling insights into my musical preferences. It provided a valuable opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of my music library, make data-driven decisions, and potentially discover hidden patterns and trends. While the analysis was limited to the scope of the dataset and the accuracy of audio features, it served as a stepping stone to enhance my knowledge and appreciation of music through a data-centric lens!
